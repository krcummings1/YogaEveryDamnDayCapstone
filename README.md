# YogaEveryDamnDay

This is the server-side code for my Back-End Capstone at Nashville Software School.

I practice yoga and often find myself wanting to do specific, advanced yoga poses, but don't know how to build up the strength and flexibility needed to do them. This app allows users to select a yoga pose from a list and see preparatory poses for the selected, advanced pose. If the user practices the corresponding preparatory poses, he or she will then be targeting the same muscles used in the selected, advanced pose and with time, will get closer to being able to the advanced pose.

I wrote my web API using C#.NET and Entity Framework, with the Code First approach.

The client-side code is in a separate repository titled, YogaEveryDamnDay-client.
